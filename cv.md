## Short info:

Hello there! My name is Egor. My goal is to learn HTML/CSS/JS and improve my skills in front-end development. **My strengths are motivation and the desire to develop.**
I thinks RS School is a great opportunity to became a frontend developer in a short time.

I live in Minsk and love to watching sports and playing csgo when I am free.
